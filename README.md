# React Todo App (Vite)

A simple but complete Todo application built using **React** and **Vite**.  
The app supports adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks, with basic validation to prevent duplicate entries.

This project was built as a hands-on learning exercise to deeply understand React fundamentals such as state management, component communication, and immutable updates.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new todos
- Prevent duplicate tasks (case-insensitive)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Clean component-based structure
- Built with Vite for fast development

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- State ownership and lifting state up
- Passing data and functions via props
- Controlled components and form handling
- Immutable state updates using `map` and `filter`
- Conditional rendering and edit modes
- Debugging real-world React issues (props mismatch, state bugs, naming consistency)
- Git workflows and version control best practices

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Font Awesome (icons)
- UUID (unique task IDs)

---

## 📚 Credits & Learning Context

This project was **inspired by a React Todo tutorial**, but the implementation here was **rebuilt independently from scratch** using Vite.  
The goal was not to replicate the tutorial, but to understand the logic, identify bugs, and implement the solution in my own way.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

These are ideas I may explore in future iterations:

- Custom fonts for improved UI
- Animations for adding, completing, and removing tasks
- Enhanced background styling / theming
- Optional sound effects for user actions
